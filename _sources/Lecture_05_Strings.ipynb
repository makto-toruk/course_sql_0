    "- literal string: series of characters enclosed in single quotes.\n",

    "- to use a single quote in a string, use two single quotes `''`\n",
    "- Concatenation\n",
    "    - standard SQL: `SELECT 'THIS' || ' & ' || 'that';`\n",
    "    - other SQLs may have slightly different operators.\n",
    "- String functions:\n",
    "    - SUBSTR, LENGTH, TRIM, UPPER, LOWER\n",
