    "# 2 SQL Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 SQL Overview\n",
    "- SQL statements are terminated with `;`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- `SELECT * FROM Countries WHERE Continent = 'Europe';`\n",
    "    - FROM clause: `FROM Countries`\n",
    "    - WHERE clause: `WHERE Continent = 'Europe';` consists of logical expression.\n",
    "These parts together constitute a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CRUD: 4 fundamental database system functions. Create Read Update Delete.\n",
    "- SELECT: all queries that return values. (R in CRUD)\n",
    "- INSERT: add a row to a table (C in CRUD).\n",
    "    - example: `INSERT INTO Customer (name, city, state)\n",
    "    VALUES ('Jimi Hendrix', 'Renton', 'WA');`\n",
    "    - Broken into two lines to improve readability.\n",
    "- UPDATE: to change data (U in CRUD)\n",
    "    - example: `UPDATE customer \n",
    "    SET \n",
    "        address = '123 Music Avenue', \n",
    "        zip = '98056' \n",
    "    WHERE id = 5;`\n",
    "- DELETE: remove rows in a table (D in CRUD).\n",
    "    - example: `DELETE FROM Customer WHERE id = 4;`\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 2.2 Database Organization\n",
    "- SQL is a language for managing a relational database.\n",
    "- Relational database: organized in two-dimensional tables (rows and columns).\n",
    "- Database can contain multiple tables.\n",
    "- Table contains rows and columns.\n",
    "- A row is an individual _record_ in a table.\n",
    "- A column is a _field_.\n",
    "- Each row in a table has a unique key. Sometimes hidden, but table must have one. \n",
    "- Tables are related by keys.\n",
    "    - example table: id | item_id | cust_id | quant | price\n",
    "    where item_id and cust_id are keys of other tables.\n",
    "    - helps use joint queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 SELECT\n",
    "examples:\n",
    "-- world.db\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SELECT 'Hello, World';`\n",
    "    - SELECT is a key word. Doesn't have to be capitalized, but common practice.\n",
    "- `SELECT 'Hello, World' AS Result;`\n",
    "    - Loads 'Hello, World' under column Result\n",
    "- `SELECT * FROM Country;`\n",
    "    - * indicates select all columns\n",
    "- `SELECT * FROM Country ORDER BY Name;`\n",
    "    - ORDER BY clause\n",
    "- `SELECT Name, LifeExpectancy FROM Country ORDER BY Name;`\n",
    "    - selected columns\n",
    "- `SELECT Name, LifeExpectancy AS \"Life Expectancy\" FROM Country ORDER BY Name;`\n",
    "    - if LifeExpectancy isn't readable, load AS. delimit using double quotes (since there is a space). Single quotes are typically used for literal string.\n",
    "    - some systems allow ignoring the keyword `AS`\n",
    "        - `SELECT Name, LifeExpectancy \"Life Expectancy\" FROM Country ORDER BY Name;`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.4 WHERE\n",
    "Selecting Rows\n",
    "-- world.db\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SELECT Name, Continent, Region FROM Country;`\n",
    "    - selects every row with the specified columns.\n",
    "- `SELECT Name, Continent, Region FROM Country WHERE Continent = 'Europe';`\n",
    "    - limits to rows WHERE continent is Europe. Europe is a literal string, so use single quotes. Without single quotes, it looks for column with name Europe.\n",
    "- `SELECT Name, Continent, Region FROM Country WHERE Continent = 'Europe' ORDER BY Name;`\n",
    "    - can ORDER as usual.\n",
    "- `SELECT Name, Continent, Region FROM Country WHERE Continent = 'Europe' ORDER BY Name LIMIT 5;`\n",
    "    - limit to 5 rows.\n",
    "- `SELECT Name, Continent, Region FROM Country WHERE Continent = 'Europe' ORDER BY Name LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;`\n",
    "    - starts the limit after OFFSET (or after the first 5).\n",
    "    \n",
    "- ORDER BY has to be _after_ any WHERE clause\n",
    "- LIMIT has to be last\n",
    "- FROM needs to be first"
